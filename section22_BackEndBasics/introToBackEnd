Internet Basics
    url --> ip address to send you to & new HTTP request is make
    www.udemy.com --> 23.235.47.175

    query is submitted to your ISP
    w/in ISP, the DNS takes Domain name & turns it into an IP adress

    Going to that address
        * a request is sent to desired IP address via HTTP
        * your request finds the fastest path possible to the server with the specified IP
        * Not direct journey
            * requires hopping from server to server until we arrive

    Udemy Server Responds
        * the requested sever figures out exactly what we're asking for ( /course)
        * server builds us the right content, often pulling info from database
        * server responds with any combo of HTML, CSS & JS



Static vs Dynamic Sites

    dynamic --> compiled on server side
        server pulling together & compiling web page before it's sent back as a response
            * could have different HTML/CSS/JS every time (ex: reddit & facebook)

    static --> what we've made so far
        same HTML/CSS/Js every time



Stacks/Back End Technologies
    stacks = which particular choices the developers made & exact technologies they used

                            Generic Stack
